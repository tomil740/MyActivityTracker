# MyActivityTracker - Goals Tracker Feature

## Overview
MyActivityTracker is a lightweight, modular Android app for tracking running activity and helping users stay on top of their weekly workout goals.â€¨Built on top of the Android Essentials Course App by Philipp Lackner, this project extends the original running tracker with a custom Goals Tracker feature, designed and implemented independently to explore real-world Android development patterns.
The app combines intuitive user flows with clean architecture and background processing â€” with a focus on scalable structure, offline-first design, and meaningful user feedback through smart notifications.

## Features Overview
The goal of this feature is to help users stay consistent with their weekly workouts. It provides a lightweight goal-setting system, progress tracking, and smart nudges to encourage healthy habits â€” all seamlessly integrated with the original run tracking flow.

### Main Goals:
- Help users reach their weekly workout goals.
- Track workouts (currently only running).
- Show progress through a visual tracker.
- Send smart reminders to stay on track with goals.

## ðŸ›  Technical Overview

This project showcases a scalable, modular Android architecture designed to handle real-world challenges like foreground services, permission-heavy features (e.g. GPS), notification scheduling, and efficient offline-first data handling â€” all in a clean, testable, and user-responsive way.

### ðŸ”§ Architecture & Modularity
- Built with a multi-module hybrid structure: feature-based modules split by layer (domain, data, presentation)
- Shared modules (`core`, `build-logic`, etc.) define base architecture, custom Gradle plugins, and common utilities (e.g., database, repository interfaces), promoting consistency and reusability across all layers.
- Foreground service flows are integrated cleanly through architectural boundaries â€” avoiding UI-layer leaks and maintaining a clear separation between app logic and service infrastructure.
- Designed for high modularity and scalability â€” ideal for long-term growth or team-based work

### ðŸ”„ Offline-First Sync & Background Work
- Local-first design using Room ensures consistent and reliable local data storage.
- Server sync handled via WorkManager, scheduled at ideal idle/wakeup moments
- Ensures user data is always in sync across devices with minimal battery/network cost

### ðŸ›° Foreground Services & GPS Tracking
- Built-in foreground service handling for continuous GPS tracking
- Full support for runtime permission flow, notification visibility, and lifecycle stability â€” both in-app and background
- GPS tracking works smoothly in active sessions and background, even during edge cases like app restarts

### ðŸ”” Smart Reminders & Notification UX
- Daily notifications to nudge users based on their weekly progress
- Interactive notification actions (e.g., Remind Me Later) integrated into clean Compose dialogs
- Works fully offline and with cached data â€” designed for minimal friction and high reliability


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to work with modular architecture, background work, and permission-heavy tasks like GPS tracking, while focusing on smooth user experience and offline functionality.
